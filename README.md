# Welcome to ChemGenie

This is a short tutorial to help you to use the app

## The Draw/Search Page

### Drawing

Simply tap anywhere on the screen within the blank canvas and drag to the end of a dotted template line to draw a bond, by default a **single Carbon-Carbon** bond. If you want to add a bond to an existing atom then simply press on any point/atom, and the dotted template lines should appear. Tapping on other parts of the canvas will do nothing. 

### Changing Elements

The bottom-right icon ![Image of the Change Element icon](./atom_icon.png) on the page will bring up a menu that you can use to change the element by typing in its symbol

### Searching for your drawing

The bottom-left icon ![Image of the Search Drawing icon](./beaker_search.png) on the page will search the database for the chemical you have drawn then bring up a Results Page

### Changing the bond order

Simply tapping the menu which says _Bond Order_ will bring up a menu that will allow you to choose between single, double and triple bonds

### Searching by name

The top search bar will enable you to search for a chemical by typing in its IUPAC name (e.g. but-2-ene) or its common name (e.g. paracetamol), then bring up a Results Page

### Clear and Undo

The **Clear** and **Undo** buttons in the top right will clear the whole page or undo the last action respectively

## Periodic Table

Press the Periodic Table icon on the menu to navigate to a periodic table
